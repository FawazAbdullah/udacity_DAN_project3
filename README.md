# Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results

## About the Project

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of this kind of experiment due to its frequency of use.
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
Steps included handling mismatched condition and page assignment, removing duplicate ids, hypothesis testing via bootstrapping and standard statistical tests, and multiple regression modelling

### Prerequisites

 - Web browser (Google Chrome recommended)
 - Anaconda (for reading iPython files efficiently)
 - Required libraries installed

### Installing

- [Web Browser]([https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
- [Anaconda]([https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))
- For installing the libraries 
	After installing anaconda, run `anaconda command prompt`. By default you will be in the base environment. You can either create your own envoronment or install required libraries in the base.
	Commands: `conda install numpy pandas matplotlib`

### Break down into end to end tests

In the notebook, Go to `Cell` and press `Run All`
If all the code ran without erros, you have done everything correctly.

### And coding style tests

Follow the [documentation]([https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/coding_style.html](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/coding_style.html)) for coding styles required in python notebooks.

## Deployment

The browser running the notebook is the live deployment of the entire code. You can edit it and have fun with it.

#### Anaconda
This is recommended to be installed for managing the iPython files efficiently
When we launch the `jupyter notebook` from the anaconda prompt, we are automacially redirected to the browser where we can find the files.

## Built With

 - [iPython]([https://ipython.org/](https://ipython.org/)) - This is the file conaining all the python codes. We can make separate blocks of iPython for performing separate tasks. File extension is `.ipynb`
- [Anaconda]([https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)) - [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. With over 11 million users worldwide, it is the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.
